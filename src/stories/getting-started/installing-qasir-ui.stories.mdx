### 1. Create boilerplate project

<p>To kickstart your new project with the Kit, we do recommend to generate a boilerplate React app with</p>

<ul>
  <li>

</ul>

### 2. Add the Kit as a dependency

<p>The next step is to add the Kit to your project as a dependancy. You can choose to install it through <code>npm</code> or <code>yarn</code>: they are both valid package managers and we don't want to recommend one over the other, but once you pick your favourite tool, simply stick with it and avoid using them simultaneously.</p>

<p>To install and save in your package.json dependencies, run:</p>

<TabsState initial="npm">
  <div id="npm" title="NPM"><div>

```sh
npm i qasir-ui
```

  </div></div>
  <div id="yarn" title="YARN"><div>

```sh
yarn add qasir-ui
```

  </div></div>  
</TabsState>

<Title>Grid</Title>
<Subtitle>The Material Design responsive layout grid adapts to screen size and orientation, ensuring consistency across layouts.</Subtitle>

<p>The <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://material.io/design/layout/responsive-layout-grid.html">grid</a> creates visual consistency between layouts while allowing flexibility across a wide variety of designs. Material Design’s responsive UI is based on a 12-column grid layout.</p>

### How it works

<p>The grid system is implemented with the <code>Grid</code> component:</p>

<ul>
<li>It uses <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" class="link">CSS’s Flexible Box module</a> for high flexibility.</li>
<li>There are two types of layout: <em>containers</em> and <em>items</em>.</li>
<li>Item widths are set in percentages, so they’re always fluid and sized relative to their parent element.</li>
<li>Items have padding to create the spacing between individual items.</li>
<li>There are five grid breakpoints: xs, sm, md, lg, and xl.</li>
</ul>
